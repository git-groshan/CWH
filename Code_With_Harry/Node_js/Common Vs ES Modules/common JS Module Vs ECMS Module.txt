In Node.js, there are two main types of modules: CommonJS (CJS) modules and ECMAScript (ES) modules. Here are the key differences between them:

1. **Syntax:**
   - CommonJS modules use `require()` to import modules and `module.exports` or `exports` to export values.
   - ECMAScript modules use `import` and `export` statements for importing and exporting values, respectively.

2. **Loading Mechanism:**
   - CommonJS modules are loaded synchronously. When a `require()` function is encountered, Node.js loads and executes the module immediately.
   - ECMAScript modules are loaded asynchronously. They are fetched and executed asynchronously, and their dependencies are resolved at runtime.

3. **Scoping:**
   - CommonJS modules have dynamic scoping. Each module has its own scope, and changes made to exported values within the module are not reflected in other modules.
   - ECMAScript modules have static scoping. They have their own scope, and the bindings are resolved at compile time, which allows for better optimization by the JavaScript engine.

4. **Top-Level `this`:**
   - In CommonJS modules, `this` refers to the `module.exports` object within the module.
   - In ECMAScript modules, `this` is `undefined` at the top level of the module.

5. **Static Analysis:**
   - ECMAScript modules support static analysis, which allows tools to optimize module loading and detect errors at compile time.
   - CommonJS modules do not support static analysis because `require()` calls are evaluated at runtime.

6. **Circular Dependencies:**
   - CommonJS modules support circular dependencies by returning an incomplete object during the first require call and completing it later.
   - ECMAScript modules do not support circular dependencies. They throw a runtime error if a circular dependency is detected.

7. **Browser Support:**
   - ECMAScript modules are native to modern browsers and can be used directly in browser environments using `<script type="module">` tags.
   - CommonJS modules are not natively supported in browsers and require bundling tools like Webpack or Browserify to be used in the browser.

In summary, CommonJS modules are synchronous and use `require()` and `module.exports`, while ECMAScript modules are asynchronous, use `import` and `export`, and have static scoping and support for static analysis. The choice between them depends on your project's requirements and the environment in which your code will run.
